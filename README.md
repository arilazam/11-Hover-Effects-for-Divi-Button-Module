# 11-Hover-Effects-for-Divi-Button-Module

I’d like to share some CSS code snippets for applying nice hover effects to Divi Button module. I used these effects in some of my projects and I thought you’d like to use them too. They are really simple code snippets but the effects are cool and the implementation is straight forward as explained below.

Step 1: Normally these effects should work fine with any button styling except for the case when the icon is set to be shown only on hover, it behaves weird so I’d prefer to disable the button icon completely.

Step 2: Add the CSS class provided for each effect to Button Module Settings -> Custom CSS -> CSS Class field.

Step 3: Copy the hover effects CSS code snippets below and add them into Divi -> Theme Options -> General -> Custom CSS field.

Copy the CSS code snippets and add them into Divi -> Theme Options -> General -> Custom CSS field. Save everything and enjoy!

Hope you’ll find these snippets useful.
